## About me
---

Hello. This is Do-yeon Yoon, who likes math and studies AI. I mainly studied combinatorics in mathematics, and I studied anti-bandwidth on graph structures. Recently, I am interested in various domains such as finance and healthcare, and I understand the key considerations of those domains. I am studying with the next goal of achieving results through the combination of graph theory and deep learning.
Thanks!&#128525;

## ETC. Project üìö

**Machine learning training** 

`PIRL(POSTECH  Information Research Laboratory), Pohang (2018.09 - 2018.10)`

- Participated as a team leader on a machine learning project team, developing machine learning model, called a *Senticle*, which is a stock price prediction model using news data.
    - NLP model using the ensemble of 1DCNN and LSTM([Go to code](https://www.github.com/ydy8989/senticle-proj))
